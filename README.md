# PongPygame
A 2 player game of pong with fun visuals and a bonus of there being two paddles at the top and bottom to be able to have a stategy and mess with the other person. The ball wil also speed up everytime it gets hit.

## Includes
*   **Easy to learn** Clear instructions provided at the start with only the arrow and wasd kays being used
*   **Fun visuals** A bright and colourful game with a rainbow trail of balls following the main one
*   **Changable game lengths?** Choose between going for 1, 2, or 3 minutes or until someone reaches 5, 10, or 15 points

## Installation

*   To play you must have a Linux computer to download the re-compiled executable and run it.

## How exactly to do this

1. *Download* Get the executable from the itch.io page (LINK!!!!!!!)

2. *Navigate* Open your terminal and navigate to a directory to open it in

3. *Execute* Run the game with this command:
    ```bash
    ./pong
    ```
# I don't think the execute thing actually works because this isn't c++ 

## How to play

*   Read the instructions at the start of the program
*   Choose the number of trailing balls by typing it
*   Choose when the game ends by pressing the corresponding button
*   Use the w and s keys to move the left paddle and the up and down keys to move the right paddle. These paddles are just for fun and only serve to annoy the other player
*   Points are awarded when the ball passes the paddle and collides with the edge
*   Game ends when the chosen parameters for ending are achieved

## Building from source
There is a way to do this with something hopefully related to source launch.
